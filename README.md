# Optical determination of image plane to specify proper distance from object to photosensitive matrix

Optyczne określanie płaszczyzny obrazu w celu wyznaczenia poprawnej odległości pomiędzy obiektem a macierzą światłoczułą

##Description
In case of registering moving objects a crucial role plays defining proper distance between the object and the photosensitive matrix. For photography, object must be sharply imaged on the matrix, while for digital holography this distance must be known to reconstruct sharp image. There are many methods of auto-focusing image in the proper plane for photography, but in case of holography the distance is measured earlier. Either using classical means or predefining it while designing optical setup. 
Therefore, the aim of this thesis is to create an algorithm determining the proper distance between the object and the photosensitive matrix. The optical setup must be designed in such way to enable registering at first photograph or hologram of point displayed on the object, and then registering the image of the object (or its hologram). The idea of calculating the distance from the shape of the defocused image of the point will help to determine the distance and therefore enable correcting the image or defining proper reconstruction distance. 

##List of the tasks:
(experimental work, theoretical work, numerical simulations, software development, etc.)

- Defining the optical setup configuration and numerical algorithm requirements;

- Designing optical setup to illuminate the object with a point and to register image of the point and of the object;

- Registering the image of the point and relating it to point spread function of the system to calculate defocus and proper image plane;

- Designing algorithm to define the distance of defocus;

- Designing algorithm to improve the registered image of the object;

- Trying to relate the distance of defocus to proper distance of reconstructing a hologram (in case of registering not photograph of the object but a digital hologram);

- Testing designed algorithm;

- Describing the results and drawing conclusions.
